# Snake Water Gun Game Using Python:-
Snake Water Gun is one of the famous two-player game played by many people. It is a hand game in which the player randomly chooses any of the three forms i.e. snake, water, and gun. Here, we are going to implement this game using python. 

This python project is to build a game for a single player that plays with the computer

## Following are the rules of the game:
**Snake vs. Water:** Snake drinks the water hence wins.

**Water vs. Gun:** The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water

**Gun vs. Snake:** Gun will kill the snake and win.

In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw.

## Random module:
The random module is a built-in module to generate the pseudo-random variables. It can be used perform some action randomly such as to get a random number, selecting a random elements from a list, shuffle elements randomly, etc.

We will use random.choice() method and nested if-else statements to select a random item from a list.
